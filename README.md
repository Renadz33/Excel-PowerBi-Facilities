The first thing I did was filter the data and delete the duplicates. There was blank data in it and I filled it out

Dax was used to count the regions and determine how many clubs were already in existence. I tried to get numerical data because the data that was present was all quantitative 📊

When I came to put the map, I discovered that it contained extremist data not inside Saudi Arabia, so I searched for it and deleted it

I tried to display the data in a way that allows you to search for clubs in the area or city you want and whether it is a men’s or women’s club so that the search will be more accurate👌🏻

I chose slicer to select the region and city
And a card to determine whether it is a men’s or women’s club
And other data that will be displayed to you so you can know the existing clubs

For example, if you choose the Makkah Al-Mukarramah region, the city of Jeddah, and a women’s facility
We will show you the number of women's clubs in Jeddah and their names
You can try it yourself on the interactive dashboard, I uploaded it on the Power BI platform in this link so that you can try and see the existing clubs ✅
